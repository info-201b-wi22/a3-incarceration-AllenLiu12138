# Assignment 3: Incarceration

In this assignment, you will use your data analysis and visualization skills to expose patterns of inequality using incarceration data collected by the Vera Institute. In doing so, you will:

- Work with a real-world, messy dataset
- Choose your own direction for analysis, including which variables to analyze and compare
- Design and build compelling visualizations to expose particular patterns in the data
- Create a website (using RMarkdown) to share your results

This assignment is more open-ended than previous ones. You will be tasked with understanding the data itself, choosing the variables you want to analyze, and deciding the optimal way to write your code. 

# Data

The data, which you will load from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends) (specifically the [incarceration_trends.csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends/master/incarceration_trends.csv)) is big and messy. A few hints on working with it:

- Data Loading: It will take about a minute to load because it's so large. Don't worry if this takes a while when you start the assignment. Feel free to save a copy of the data (or a subset of it) in your directory
- Read the documentation: Follow this link to download the "Codebook" that explains the meaning of each variable. You'll need to understand what each variable represents, so read carefully!
- Beware of missing values: You don't need to worry about "imputing" these, but when choosing what to visualize, you will want to focus on a particular location and/or year that has sufficient data (note, this varies across the variables)
- Take your time: You should expect to spend 2 or 3 hours studying the data and the documentation to understand the structure of this data set. Be patient!

# Assignment Structure

For this assignment, you will create an .Rmd report about incarceration in the U.S., which must include:

- An introduction of the problem domain and a description of the variable(s) you are choosing to analyze (and why!)
- A paragraph of summary information, citing at least 5 values calculated from the data
- A description of the dataset, who collected it, why, and any limitations or problems with the data
- A chart that shows trends over time for a variable of your choice
- A chart that compares two variables to one another
- A map that shows how your measure of interest varies geographically

Once you have completed your report, make sure to **change your repository settings** so that you can view the hosted website, which will be available at https://info-201b-wi22.github.io/REPO_NAME
